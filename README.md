# Hi... Welcome to GitHub Repository of `Kiran's Resume`

## So, What is Kiran's Resume ?

It's basically a website where people or more specifically other Developers or HR manager can find more and updated information about me.

See the problem with physical or electronic resume like PDF is that sometimes they contains outdated information like work experience or contact information. So that's why I want to create an online version of my resume which is going to be updated constantly with latest skills and experiences.
