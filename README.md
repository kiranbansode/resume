# Hi... Welcome to GitHub Repository of `Kiran's Resume`

## So What is Kiran's Resume ?

It's basically a website where people or more specifically other Developers or HR manager can find more and updated information about me.

See the problem with physical or electronic resume like PDF is that sometimes they contains outdated information like work experience or contact information. So that's what I want to create an online version of my resume which is going to updated constantly with latest skills and experiences

## What's project status ?

For last 2 months this project was in planning phase. All project related mental modals are ready. Soon going work on designs in Figma. Once designs are finalized, I'll try to release a MVP as soon as possible. Till then sit tight and wait.

## Why it is taking so much time ?

It is taking some time because I was working on my other project which is VoteSub. You can have a look of it [here](https://github.com/kiranbansode/votesub)
